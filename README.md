# Persistent Homology with Coral Prunit

We develop two new, remarkably simple but effective algorithms to compute the exact persistence diagrams of large graphs to address the computational complexity constraints in TDA. First, we prove that (k + 1)-core of a graph G is sufficient to compute its k th persistence diagram, P Dk(G). Second, we introduce a pruning algorithm for graphs to compute their persistence diagrams by removing the dominated vertices. Our experiments on large networks indicate that the new approach can achieve computational gains up to 95%.
